# Green gren what is yur problem gren

Switches from tense sitting there waiting, to him talking when you talk into your microphone.

## How to use

1. Install Java 11
2. Run JAR file
3. Open OBS
4. Add new source -> Browser -> URL: http://localhost:8019
5. Set width and height to 300x125
6. Press OK
7. You can use this for whatever purpose you want. I tried it with Virtual Camera in OBS to use in a discord call.

If you restart the JAR file, you need to refresh the browser source in OBS.

## Improvements

- [ ] Make tense more responsive.
- [ ] Add quick GUI to change noise gate level because different microphones have different noise levels
- [ ] Recognise speech (or remove noise) so that things like keyboard doesn't make tense talk
- [ ] Add 3rd enraged tense tier
